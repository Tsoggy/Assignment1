# Challenge 1: Kickstarting with Excel

## Susan Tsoglin

### Purpose of this project.
This is our first project. Using excel, this project analyzes different kickstarter projects: when their campaigns were launched and how successful the campaigns were based on dollar amount pledged vs. the original goal.

## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
Based on the data, Louise would have a greater likelihood of succeeding with her fundraising goals if she was to launch her kickstarter in May.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
More projects were successful with lower fundraising goals. In addition, due to the fact that we have a very large amount of projects with lower fundraising goals, we know that if Louise were to have a lower goal, her kickstarter would have a much greater likelihood of succeeding. The larger the goal, the less trustworthy the data; there are very few projects with larger fundraising goals, and the reasons behind why each project succeeded or failed isn't clear here.

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
The challenges I encountered within excel were all user error: I missed a punctuation where I needed it, which resulted in an error. I copied/pasted without $ which changed the cells selected. All of these small mistakes helped me to remember what is important. I also encountered difficulty with creating SSH keys, which I solved by watching two separate youtube videos, and talking to another student who was successful with this.

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
- 1. The best month for launching a kickstarter is during the month of May.
2. Kickstarters during the month of December have an almost equal likelihood of being successful as failing.

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
-Generally speaking, there is a higher likelood of failure with a higher fundraising goal, except for a few projects that still may succeed with high fundraising goals. We do not, however, know why those succeeded. Keeping fundraising goals below $14,999 increases the chances of success.

- What are some limitations of this dataset?
-This dataset is missing a few key pieces of data that may be relevant to the outcome. We do not know how many people were involved in each kickstarter and whether more people fundraising for one project would result in greater success vs. less people fundraising. This data doesn't show the demographics of those who contributed financially. If, for example, very few people gave large sums of money to the projects, it would be important to know which people and how to target them for future contributions.

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
-We could create a table that delivered information about which years produced more successful outcomes, as well as which years produced less successful outcomes. We could create a table that showed successful outcomes based on how much time each kickstarter had to fundraise to see if there is a correlation between longer fundraising and success in meeting goals.
